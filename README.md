Pre-configured solution for Remote Monitoring with Azure IoT
============================================================

This is the "top level" repo for the Azure IoT PCS Remote Monitoring solution.  
This repository contains submodules for each dotnet microservice and the React Web 
UI project.  It also contains instructions and scripts on how to get remote 
monitoring running locally and in your Azure cloud subscription.  Each 
microservice is built to run standalone - to view and use a microservice 
independently click on a microservice submodule and view the readme.md for it.  

Overview
========

Remote Monitoring is an end to end solution that showcases how a remote 
monitoring IoT solution can be built and deployed for Azure IoT.  The 
solution implements a number of uses cases including: registering devices, 
sending telemetry from devices, creating rules and specifying alarms 
for telemetry, sending commands to devices (e.g. reboot).  Remote Monitoring 
can be deployed and run local or in the cloud.  When run local cloud access 
must be available so as to allow access to required cloud resources, e.g. 
the IoT Hub.

Remote Monitoring uses Docker containers to host microservices and the React UI.  
Microservices allow communication through REST/HTTP.  When running locally 
microservices can also be executed inside an IDE (Visual Studio, VS Code, etc.). 
When running in the cloud the microservices are hosted using Azure Container 
Service (ACS) and Kubernetes as the Container Orchestrator.

How to use it
=============

To run Remote Monitoring on your local machine:
1. Clone the repo with:
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-dotnet
2. Install Docker: https://www.docker.com/.
3. Create your IoT Hub either using the Azure Portal or by executing the IoT Hub 
creation helper script in the cloned repo: 
azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-dotnet/scripts/iothub/create-hub.sh
4. Create required environment variables:
<todo - need a script for this>
5. Run the local deployment script:
<todo>

To run Remote Monitoring in your cloud subscription:
<TODO>

Configuration
=============

Remote Monitoring uses environment variables for required configuration.  Required 
environment variables are:
- Name=PCS_IOTHUB_CONN_STRING Value=<Your IoT Hub Connection String>
- <todo - ports for each msvc>

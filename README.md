Overview
========
> There is a Java version of this repo available [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-java)

Remote monitoring helps you get better visibility into your devices, assets, and
sensors wherever they happen to be located. You can collect and analyze real-time
device data using a remote monitoring solution that triggers automatic alerts and
actions â€” from remote diagnostics to maintenance requests. You can also command and
control your devices.

[Azure IoT Hub][iot-hub]
is a key building block of the remote monitoring solution. IoT Hub is a fully
managed service that enables reliable and secure bidirectional communications between
millions of IoT devices and a solution back end.

Check out the [Interactive Demo](http://www.microsoftazureiotsuite.com/demos/remotemonitoring)
for a detailed overview of features and use cases.

To get started you can follow along with the Getting Started for a command line deployment. You can also deploy using the web interface at https://www.azureiotsolutions.com.

### Documentation
See more documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-suite/).

Getting Started
===============

## Deploy a solution
There are two ways to deploy a solution:
1) Deploy using the web interface using the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-suite/iot-suite-remote-monitoring-deploy).
2) Deploy using the [command line](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-suite/iot-suite-remote-monitoring-deploy-cli).
3) Deploy locally using instructions [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-dotnet/blob/master/docs/LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT.md).

Common Scenarios
================
## Create additional simulated devices
Once you have a solution up and running, you can [create additional simulated devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-suite/iot-suite-remote-monitoring-test). You can then stop the default simulated devices by calling the simulation endpoint with the instructions [here](https://github.com/Azure/device-simulation-dotnet/wiki/%5BAPI-Specifications%5D-Simulations#stop-simulation).

## Connect a physical device!
By default, the solution once spun up uses simulated devices. You can start adding your
own devices with the instructions here: 
* [Connect a physical device](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-suite/iot-suite-connecting-devices-node)

## Customize the Web UI
You can find information about customizing the remote monitoring solution [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-suite/iot-suite-remote-monitoring-customize).
